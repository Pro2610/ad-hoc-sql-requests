# Req 006 — Is a Single User Distorting Revenue Metrics?

## 📌 Request
Revenue metrics look unusually high.
Is a single user (or a small group of users) distorting overall performance?

## 🧩 Business Context
Outliers can mislead dashboards and decision-making.
Before acting on spikes in revenue or ARPPU, we need to verify whether:
- growth is broadly distributed, or
- driven by a single high-value user.

## 📐 Definitions
- **Outlier user**: a user whose revenue contribution is disproportionately high
  compared to the rest of the population.
- Focus period: **current month**.
