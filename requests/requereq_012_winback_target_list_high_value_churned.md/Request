# Req 012 — Win-back Target List (High-value Churned Users Last Month)

## 📌 Request
Generate a target list of high-value users who churned last month
to run a win-back campaign.

## 🧩 Business Context
Win-back campaigns are most efficient when targeted at users with:
- proven high historical value,
- recent churn (still recoverable),
- clear business impact if reactivated.

This request produces a **prioritized list**.

## 📐 Definitions
- **Churned last month**: user had revenue in last month, and **no revenue in current month**
- **High-value user**: top users by last month revenue (or historical revenue)
- **Priority**: highest last-month revenue first (optionally combined with historical value)
