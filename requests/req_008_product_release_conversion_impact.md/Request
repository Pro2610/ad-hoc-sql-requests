# Req 008 — Did a Product Release Impact Conversion?

## 📌 Request
A product release went live recently.
Did it impact conversion rates?

## 🧩 Business Context
After product releases, stakeholders want fast confirmation:
- Did conversion improve?
- Did anything break?
- Should we roll back or proceed?

This analysis compares **conversion before vs after the release**.

## 📐 Definitions & Assumptions
- **Release date**: replace with actual date (example: `2025-03-10`)
- **Conversion**: user makes at least one payment
- Compare:
  - 7 days **before** release
  - 7 days **after** release
- This is a **quick impact check**, not a full experiment.
