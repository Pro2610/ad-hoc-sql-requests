# Req 003 — Why Paid Users Dropped Yesterday?

## 📌 Request
Paid users dropped yesterday.
Can we identify the root cause?

## 🧩 Assumptions
- Paid user = user with at least one payment per day
- Compare **yesterday** vs **previous 7-day daily average**
- Use `payment_date`, `user_id`, `revenue_amount`
- Optional segmentation: `location`, `software_name`, `User Type`
