# Req 010 — Root Cause Drilldown Template

## 📌 Request
A KPI changed unexpectedly.  
Provide a structured SQL template to quickly identify the root cause.

## 🧩 Business Context
When a metric moves unexpectedly (revenue, paid users, conversion),
analysts must quickly determine:
- what changed,
- where the change occurred,
- which segment caused it.

This template standardizes the **root cause drilldown workflow**.

## 📐 Investigation Framework
Root cause analysis should follow this order:

1. Confirm the metric change
2. Decompose metric drivers
3. Identify segment contribution
4. Check outliers
5. Verify persistence
