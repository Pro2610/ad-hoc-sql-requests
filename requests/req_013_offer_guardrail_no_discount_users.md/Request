# Req 013 — Offer Guardrail: Who Should NOT Get Discounts

## 📌 Request
Identify users who should **NOT receive discounts**, in order to protect revenue and margins.

## 🧩 Business Context
Not all users require incentives.
Providing discounts to already loyal or high-value users can reduce ARPPU
without increasing retention.

This request identifies users who:
- purchase consistently,
- show low churn risk,
- maintain strong revenue contribution.

These users should be excluded from discount campaigns.

## 📐 Guardrail Logic
Users should **NOT receive discounts** if they:
1. Made payments recently (active users)
2. Show stable or increasing transaction frequency
3. Have strong historical value (high revenue)
4. Have low churn risk
