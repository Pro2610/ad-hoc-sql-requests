# Req 014 — Segment Mix Shift Weekly Monitoring Table

## 📌 Request
Create a weekly monitoring table to track segment mix shifts over time.

## 🧩 Business Context

- product mix
- user type mix

Weekly monitoring helps detect:
- marketing mix changes,
- campaign quality shifts,
- regional performance issues.

## 📐 Monitoring Logic
For each week and segment:
- Revenue
- Paid users
- Revenue share
- Paid user share
