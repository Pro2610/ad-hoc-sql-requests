# Req 011 — ARPPU Change: Mix Shift vs Within-Segment Change

## 📌 Request
ARPPU changed recently.  
Was the change driven by:
- performance changes within segments, or
- a shift in user mix (segment composition)?

## 🧩 Business Context
Aggregate ARPPU can change even when segment performance remains stable,
if the share of high-value or low-value segments changes.

Understanding the driver is critical for:
- marketing decisions,
- pricing strategy,
- campaign evaluation.

## 📐 Analysis Logic
We compare:
- **Previous period vs Current period**
- Segment-level ARPPU
- Segment revenue share
