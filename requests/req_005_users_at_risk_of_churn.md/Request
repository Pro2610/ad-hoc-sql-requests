# Req 005 — Which Users Are at Risk of Churn Next Month?

## 📌 Request
Which users are most likely to churn next month?

## 🧩 Business Context
Churn prevention is more effective than win-back.
The goal is to **identify at-risk users early** and prioritize retention actions
before revenue is lost.

This is a **risk-based heuristic analysis**, not a predictive ML model.

## 📐 Risk Heuristics (Simple & Explainable)
A user is considered **at risk of churn** if one or more conditions apply:
- No payment in the last **30 days**
- Decreasing payment frequency
- Declining monthly revenue
- Previously high ARPPU (higher business impact)
