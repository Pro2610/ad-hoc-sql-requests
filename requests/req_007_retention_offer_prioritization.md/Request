## 📌 Request
Which users should be prioritized for retention offers to maximize revenue impact?

## 🧩 Business Context
Retention budgets are limited.
Sending offers to all users is inefficient and costly.
The goal is to **prioritize users with the highest expected business impact**
if they churn — and the highest likelihood to be saved.

This analysis combines:
- churn risk,
- user value,
- prioritization logic.

## 📐 Prioritization Logic (Simple & Explainable)
A user should receive a retention offer first if:
1) They show **high churn risk**
2) They have **high historical value (ARPPU / revenue)**
3) They were **recently active** (still salvageable)

This is a **rule-based scoring**, not an ML model.
